    Vennesla Library and Cultural Center, Vennesla, Norway
    This library in Norway is made of a series of arcs, or "ribs," that support the roof. The concept of the building comes from the ribs of a whale skeleton.
    "In this project, we developed a rib concept to create usable hybrid structures that combine a timber construction with all technical devices and the interior," architects Helen & Hard told ArchDaily.
